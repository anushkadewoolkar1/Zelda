Time Taken: 15 minutes

(+) Using the switch statement on all enums is a fast and efficient way to cycle through all possible cases of side.

(-) The class doesn’t completely implement the behavior when Link takes damage, as the respective animation does not move Link backwards when he is damaged.

(+) Ruling out the null case prevents any errant crashes from null objects colliding.

The collisions with enemies has identical behavior to collisions with enemy projectiles, should they be refactored into a single class or remain separate?

Suggested Change: Although this probably isn’t the responsibility of the collision class, the behavior of Link when he hits an enemy in the game should be to quickly jump backwards in a continuous animation. When this happens, Link could potentially be locked into an animation state (which would include invulnerability) which would send him backwards.

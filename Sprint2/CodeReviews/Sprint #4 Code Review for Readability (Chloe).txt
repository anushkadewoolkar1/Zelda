Time Taken: 15 minutes


(-) Some fields, such as enemyPosition, sourceRectangle, and Direction are not assigned nor referenced in the code.


(-) Is there any way to refactor so that there aren’t two different Draw() and Update() methods in the class?


(-) Some properties, such as Rows, Cols, and  seem to be able to simply be able to exist as local variables, are they used in an essential way in other classes? Because if not, it seems that they can be refactored entirely into local variables.


(-) A lack of comments on class methods or the instance methods of different fields/arguments give the reader little idea of what the class exactly does.

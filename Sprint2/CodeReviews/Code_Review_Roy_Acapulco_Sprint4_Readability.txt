- I like the consistent boolean variable naming conventions, it makes it clear when there is a flag in the code.

- There are no unused imports or variables (unlike many other files in this project right now) which makes it less bloated.

- It's good that so many variables are private so there's less to worry about other files modifying them when trying to debug something.

- AdjustProjectile is a bit long, there are many if statements that could trivially be split up into multiple functions, making it more readable and concise.

- While the flag names might be consistent, the naming conventions for the other variables are not quite as good. Ex: some private fields have a _ before them
and otheres not at all. Make all private ones _ and others without the underscore.

- Once again, too many hardcoded numbers, use const variables instead.

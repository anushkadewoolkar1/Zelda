Link.cs
Author of Code: Kyle Dietrich
Time: 20 minutes

Notes:
Constructor Link looks easily scalable with limited dependencies.
Update() also looks easily scalable.
Draw() looks good, just duplicate methods with DrawCurrentSprite().
ChangeState() is a small piece of code with low complexity.
Move() implements a fixed speed formula. If link were to need to accelerate, there shouldn't be too much to add.
PerformAttack() is jumping on top of implementing a hitbox. Might be premature to implement a hitbox and should probably be handled by calling LinkAttackingState.
PickUpItem() and UseItem() are good generic methods. Using an item will need to create a Sprite that will also need to be drawn and updated by the Draw() and Update() respectively.
Vulnerability methods has well thought out functionality.
Nice Addition of HandleDeathStart() and HandleDeathCompletion(). Will need to be called by Command.

Potential Changes:
The one interaction that might need a separate method is knockback.

Specific comments on code quality:
	The class is well structed and organized. The use of IEnemyState helps encapsulate different enemy behaviors.
	The SetHealth method is helps keep health centralized and easy to modify.
	Varaibles and methods follow clear naming convention.

	Many fields at the top probably should be private (position, enemyType, EnemyHealth,....)
	Some redundant switch cases in ChangeDirection()
		could just call the spritefactory once since it knows direction already
	ChangeEnemyForward and ChangeEnemyBackward could be combined and pass the a boolean in

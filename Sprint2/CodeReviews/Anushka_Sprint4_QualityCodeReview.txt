Specific comments on code quality:
	Pros: The class fullfills a single responsibility of mapping user inputs to command instances
		  The use of dictionary creates cleare and concise mapping that is easy to read and extend
		  Follows good practices and is well structered
	Cons: Some unused dependecies
		  Some inline comments could be useful for explaining commands and why they are used, but the names mostly do that already

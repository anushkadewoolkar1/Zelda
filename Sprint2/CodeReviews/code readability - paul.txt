Code readability comments:
	
- The debug line in CollisionManager is a bit vague and the purpose of it isn't really understandable by whoever didn't write it without further digging.
- Make the naming clear, BORDER_POSITION_VALUE, doesn't make muuch sense since its just an int, what value of the border is it referring to, the corner coords?
- I know this isn't readbility but enemy doesn't build in LinkLevelCollisionHandler. Don't push things that don't build if it will inhibit progress for the whole project.
- The if statements in CheckDynamicCollisions could be abstracted into a method to avoid repeated lines of code since the if statements are only checking the type
of the object.

Sprint 2
Game1.cs and Commands.cs (Focusing on the command part of both)

* FOCUSED ON READABILITY *

First Game1.cs
- First of all, there are unnecessary comments everywhere that are not needed anymore (mainly things from Sprint 0 that can be deleted).

- Also, the LoadContent method is very very long. It's not super difficult to read because of the comments segmenting the different sections of LoadContent(loading textures,
creating blocks, etc), but splitting these sections into separate methods will make it less cluttered and easier to look for things.

- This isn't exactly readability, but very important; The block implementation doesn't use commands yet, it does it somewhere in the block files, this needs to 
be changed to keep consistency within the project and requires work from the block implementer as well.

- Very minor but some variables say append Cmd and others append Command, just keep it consistent.

Commands.cs

- The class naming conventions are not consistent. We have QuitCommand, SetSpriteCommand, then ChangeLinkState, CycleEnemy. The last 2 I mentioned should have 
command appended to the name for readability/consistency once again.

- Perhaps add a comment on ChangeLinkState since that's a relatively vague variable name explaining what it does. At first glance, I'm not sure exactly
which state(s) it's trying to change.

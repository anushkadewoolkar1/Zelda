Notes:
All variables are descriptive with some variables not in use. (Could still use some commenting and grouping)
Constructor, Initialize, and LoadContent methods are brief but could use some comments.
Update and Draw are succinct but there seems to be repeated method calls for updategameState/draw for IDisplay objects
Also, there seems to be commented out debugging code in Update.
CurrentSprite method is not in use
LoadDynamicObjects method could use some commenting
All other methods are short and are self-explanatory


Potential Change:
Make sure to delete old code that isn't being used or is commented out.
Adding more comments would help clarify sections of code, don't need to comment every line.
Try to avoid redundancy, like calling the same method multiple times.

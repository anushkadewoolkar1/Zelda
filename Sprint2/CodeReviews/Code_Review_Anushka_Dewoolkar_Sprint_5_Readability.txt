Notes:
Currently using Command Design Pattern.
Class names are descriptive, should still include comment about functionality as Execute often is just a single method.
Side note, some classes are not used.
Grouping together similar classes would help with reading flow.

Overall,
Command Design Pattern was a good choice.
Some light commenting could help with readability.
Grouping similar classes would also help.

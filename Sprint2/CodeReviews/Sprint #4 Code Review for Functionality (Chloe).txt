Sprint #4 Code Review for Functionality:

Time Taken: 20 minutes




(+) Uses Singleton pattern to access new object instance, protects potential conflicts of object creation in different classes.


(+) Encasing sound effects as individual methods of an audio class makes it easier to directly access and execute these methods.


(-) There is a null check on the second sound effect, but none on the remainder of the sound effects.


(-) If more sound effects or music tracks are needed, they will need to be hard encoded in the code file (not really that important for a game of this scale though)


A suggestion I would have for the code would be to add null checks to all of the sound effects / music methods in order to ensure the program doesn’t crash if a sound effect file is null.

Comments:
- Could change the public debug variables to private
- I think the DispatchLevelCollisions function was written by somebody else, but that could possibly eventually be integrated / refactored with CheckDynamicCollision
- Should probably make more functions for CheckDynamicCollisions to call (like maybe making a function that sets the CollisionHandler) (honestly it makes the same point at the last bullet I made about merging DispatchLevelCollisions and CheckDynamicCollision)
- Some of the directories could be removed so the class isn't loading quite as much whenever the program first starts running

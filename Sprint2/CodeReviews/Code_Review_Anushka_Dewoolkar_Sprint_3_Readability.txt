Notes:
DIM is an unconventional shortening of dimensions, fore readability, I think it would be better to type out dimensions fully
Otherwise, constants are well named
Parameter names are well defined and understandable
Comments inside draw are helpful, even with the structure being intuitive
BoundingBox method's rectangle easily parsed.


Overall,
Methods are short and self-explanatory.
Constants are very illustrative.
All this results in nice readable code.

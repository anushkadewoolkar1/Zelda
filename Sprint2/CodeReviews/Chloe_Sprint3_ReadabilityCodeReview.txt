Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	Methods are named well and make it easy to tell the purpose of the code and the structure of the class is overall pretty good

	The Update() method is difficult to read. You could extract logic into helper methods to make easier to understand
		Something like this maybe:
			                    Vector2 move = Vector2.Zero;
                                enemy.Speed = 100f;
                                int random = RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32(-1, 2);

                                switch (enemy.enemyType)
                                {
                                    case EnemyType.OldMan:
                                        enemy.Speed = 0; 
                                        break;
            
                                    case EnemyType.Keese:
                                        move = AdjustMoveForKeese(random);
                                        break;

                                    case EnemyType.Stalfos:
                                        if (timer == 0 || timer == 50)
                                            enemy.ChangeDirection((Direction)random);
                                        move = MoveDirection(enemy.Direction);
                                        break;
                                    case EnemyType.Goriya:
                                        move = AdjustMoveForGoriya(random);
                                        break;
                                        ...
                                        ...
                                        ...
        Also Gel and Zol have similar movement logic so you might be able to combine those

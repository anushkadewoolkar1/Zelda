Comments:
- Variable names are clear and understandable, plus they follow C# guidelines
- Comments made in areas where the code might be a bit more complicated to deduce just from taking a glance (helped me understand DetermineCollisionSide when I was implementing my code)
- Spaces between each if-else statement exist so the whole class isn't ugly to look at from all the cramped code (useful for functions like CheckDynamicCollision)

Comments:
(+) Code is well-indented & well-spaced, allowing for blocks and nests to be obvious at first glance.
(-) Lack of summary comments before blocks results in a significantly longer time to read through the code and comprehend each block’s purpose.
(+) Descriptive yet concise variable & method names allow for a variable/method’s purpose to be immediately understood by the reader.
(-) Lack of commenting on the behavior of a method call outside the class requires the reader to reference other files in order to get a basic understanding of the class’s behavior.
(-) Although I can personally understand the code due to having prior understanding of the program’s behavior, it is unlikely that a non-developer would be able to understand the file without comments.

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
    Overall structure is readable and organized with meaningful names and has been refactored well to shorten the length.
    The naming coventions and descriptive variable names make it easier to read. the seperation of controller setup, assest loading,
    and game state handling make it clear what the code is doing. The added helper methods also contribute to this.

    Adding some inline commments could help with readability and grouping related fields and methods. Such as the busy-wait loop
    in EnterPauseMode or the rendering target calculations could use more comments to help explain.

Author of Code: Chloe Feller
Time Taken: 25 minutes

Notes:
Factory design pattern used to create enemy sprites
LoadAllTextures() keeps all textures loading in one place, which is good for maintainability
CreateEnemySprite() uses switch statements, making it easy to see how enemies are instantiated
CreateSmallEnemySprite(), CreateLargeEnemySprite(), and CreateBossEnemySprite() have repeated code which can probably be consolidated into one method with parameters

Hypothetical Change: Adding different animation speeds to different enemies. This would require changing delay or passing in a speed as a parameter for each EnemyType.

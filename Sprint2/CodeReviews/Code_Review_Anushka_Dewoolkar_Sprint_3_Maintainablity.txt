Block.cs
Author of Code: Anushka Dewoolkar
Time: 10 minutes

Notes:
Variables names are easily parsed
Constructor is succinct without unnecessary bloat
IsSolid and IsPushable are good for future proofing
Block currently acts as an abstract class, therefore, the class's draw "hides" the invisibleblock class's draw underneath
Update requires keyboardstate, which is low cohesion

Potential Change:
Maybe make Block abstract if you want to continue using inheritance and remove the keyboardState from update.

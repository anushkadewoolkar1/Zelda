Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	What is:
	The class and method names are specific and clearly label behaviors.
	The variable naming is also clear and self-explanatory for what they do.
	The boolean logic is also clear. If link is damaged, increment the clock and color link diffirently in draw.
	Swtich statemetns in draw are clear and show that every 8 ticks it cycles through a color.

	What is not:
	Magic numbers are not entirely clear. using named constants might be better or enums
	LinkStates array is not super clear for someone who hasnt worked on this. Maybe an struct for this would be good with named properties
	Some conditional logic is unclear such as yCoordinate < 45 or (LinkStates[2] % 2) == 1. A small comment for these would be great

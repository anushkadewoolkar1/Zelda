Readable: 
	Naming conventions and moethd names are clear and easy to read. The order 
	of the check in Update() also are logically easy to understand. Also the 
	inline comments hepl with understanding functionality

Less-Readable:
	Adding extra line spacing between the input group could help visually for 
	reading. The levelMap and menu map could be renamed to levelCommandMap and 
	menuCommandMap for better clarity. Lastly maybe changing the wording of 
	the joystick threshold comment could help for my clarity as well. Something
	like "If joystick direction exceeds a threshold, treat it as intentional
	movement in that direction."

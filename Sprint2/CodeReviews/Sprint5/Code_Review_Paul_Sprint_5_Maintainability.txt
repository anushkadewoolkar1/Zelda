Code quality comments:
	Methods are named well and encapsulate behavior nicely. The logic to prevent
	repeated executions is great and prevents unintended command spamming. Inline 
	comments could be cleaned up a bit. 

Hypothectical change:
	Add support for multiplayer gameplay. The playercontroller is flexiblwe and a
	second playercontroller2 could be added for second player input. the command maps
	are per controller so each player can be managed easily. The shared gameStateCopy
	might be confusing if multiple players are in the same state. so doing something 
	to one player only could be tricky. The current desing does support multiplayer but 
	being careful to ensure all state and flags remain true for each instance would be
	important.

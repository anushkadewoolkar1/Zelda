Sprint 5
File Name: ShaderManager.cs and CollisionManager.cs
Author of Code: Aidan Roley
Time Spent: 20 minutes

- Code follows C# naming conventions, making it easy to differentiate types of variables
- Plenty of comments to understand any confusing code and separate methods

CollisionManager:
- Commented out code could be erased, but it's all placed at the bottom so it isn't really in the way
- Space between lines helps to differentiate when the "goal" of the code changes (ex. plenty of space between an if/else statement, or between methods)
- lastSide variable could be deleted, as it looks like it is only assigned a value in DetermineCollisionSide but is not used anywhere else

ShaderManager:
- File is very short and all methods can fit inside one screen (the entire file can fit in one screen)

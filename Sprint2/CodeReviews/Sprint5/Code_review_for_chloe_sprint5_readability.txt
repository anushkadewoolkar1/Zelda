- It would probably be a good idea to move the constants elsewhere (to a different file) since there are so many.
- Constants like TWO and THREE aren't good naming conventions; try to find ways to not use them while avoiding magic numbers.
- Property naming is not always consistent.
- SetHealth() is called twice in the constructor since it calls CreateEnemy and SetHealth, but CreateEnemy already calls it
- There are big control flow blocks in the drawing code that could be split up into multiple functions to make it more readable

As for the change, I think the most important thing to do would be to move all of the constants to a separate class and remove the
variables names that are just a number in the constants.

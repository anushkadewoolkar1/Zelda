Minutes Taken for Code Review: 10 minutes
Comments:
- Could remove PauseLevel, LeaveMenu and SwitchDisplay methods in StartMenu, DeathScreen and WinMenu, as they have no references.
- Interfaces are designed to be used by all 3 classes (StartMenu, WinMenu, and DeathScreen) without needing to add unnecessary special cases
- Methods generally have 2-3 lines of code, which is useful for a shorter runtime.
- Content isn't loaded until it is needed, which prevents unnecessary content from being loaded too early.

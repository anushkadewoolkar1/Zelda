Sprint4
HUD.cs
Author of Code: Aidan Roley
Time: 10 minutes

Notes:
All variables are necessary
Constructor and UpdateGameState are small.
Each spriteBatch.Draw has it's parameters laid out line by line.
Rectangle names are well though out (except maybe bottomSource is kinda ambiguous).
How heart's are drawn is clean and intuitive.


Overall,
Methods are short and variables names are self-explanatory.
Use of constants would probably help make the code more illustrative of functionality.
Code is well laid out and is easy to read line by line.
Could also use deleting the unused imports.

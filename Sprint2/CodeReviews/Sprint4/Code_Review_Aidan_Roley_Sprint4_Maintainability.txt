Notes:
currentItem isn't currently being use.
pickedUpItems is also not currently being used.
Many ints that can be replaced with constants (Helps with maintainability).
New Line for each parameter for draw helps with readability.
Each case of ItemType is nicely separated but could be represented with a switch.


Potential Change:
Definitely add constants to make changing the values easier.
Delete some of the unused variables like pickUpItems and currentItem.
Can also delete some of the unused imports.

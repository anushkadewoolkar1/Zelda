Specific comments on code quality:
- Uses a singleton pattern appropriately for a force manager, avoiding multiple instances of gravity affecting objects inconsistently.
- The GRAVITY_FORCE constant prevents the use of magic numbers.
- The ApplyForce method correctly updates both position and velocity, ensuring objects respond visibly to the applied force.
- Type-checking via as casts (gameObject as Enemy, gameObject as Link) causes repetitive code and tight coupling. If you use an interface or inheritance, it would reduce duplication.
- The ToggleForce method accepts a parameter (IGameObject gameObject) but does not use it.

Hypothetical Change:
You can introduce a new object type, FallingPlatform, which should also be affected by gravity.
This would require adding a new else if ((gameObject as FallingPlatform) != null) block inside ApplyForce().
Repeating the same logic used for Enemy and Link.

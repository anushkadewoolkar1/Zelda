Time: 20 minutes

Notes:
I'm a little confused on Position, IsInvulnerably, Health, and ItemType. Are they going to be properties or variables
Link Constructor is thoroughly commented
The vulnerability Timer is readable
There seems to be both Draw() and DrawCurrentSprite() with the same functionality
Second part of Move could be better clarified (Maybe Change dt to deltatime?)
PerformAttack() currently has lots of commented out code, still readable
UseItem() also has lots of commented out code, still readable
The two vulnerability methods are well commented.
Same with Death Start and Completion.

Overall,
Methods have an appropriate name and are self-explanatory.
Variables are very descriptive.
Very readable code.

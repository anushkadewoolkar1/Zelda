Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	What is:
	The method names are clear and accurately describe their functionality.
	The use of collections (blocksList, enemiesList, itemsList, gameObjects) makes it easy to follow the structure of the room's objects.
	The overall class structure logically separates initialization, updates, and rendering.	

	What is not:
	LoadRoom(int xCoordinate, int yCoordinate) is too long, making it hard to understand. You can split it into helper functions like FindRoomInFile(), ClearOldRoom(), InstantiateRoomObjects().
	The LoadRoom method has deeply nested while and if statements, making it harder to read.
	Some outdated TODO comments are still in the file.
	Some logic sections (like object removal in LoadRoom) don't have comments.

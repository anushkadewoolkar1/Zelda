Maintainability.

- I really like the use of decorator pattern/system with this because it makes combining different functionality like rotation and movement
possible without extremely long and bloated control flow statements.

- I also like the use of projection client in order to organize the updating/logical things elsewhere with a clear entry point.

- When it comes to what could be better, the amount of hardcoded numbers is a bit large, making them into const variables would make this better.

- There are many classes which use some sort of timer. You could make another class (or some sort of encapsulation) that holds one timer that you use for everything
so it's not as disorganized.

- Lots of classes in here change the properties of ProjectileSprite directly. I would recommend creating methods instead of directly changing the variables
as a means of reducing coupling.
